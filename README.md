## What Cachet is not

Here is a list of things that Cachet is not or does not do:

1. It does not monitor your services. It works only as a way to display the status of your services. *However, Cachet is able to receive updates from third-party services via its API.*
2. It does not work on a plugin system. There are no monitoring services to extend.
3. It's not a Twitter clone.

## Quickstart with Docker

Run a DB container (you can either pass in environment variables for the DB, or mount a config with `-v /my/database.php:/var/www/html/app/config/database.php`):

```bash
$ export DB_USERNAME=cachet
$ export DB_PASSWORD=cachet
$ export DB_ROOT_PASSWORD=cachet
$ export DB_DATABASE=cachet
$ docker run --name mysql -e MYSQL_USER=$DB_USERNAME -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=$DB_PASSWORD  -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=$DB_ROOT_PASSWORD -e MYSQL_DATABASE=$DB_DATABASE -d mysql
```

Initialize the DB if you haven't yet:

```bash
$ docker run --link mysql:mysql -e DB_HOST=mysql -e DB_DATABASE=$DB_DATABASE -e DB_USERNAME=$DB_USERNAME -e DB_PASSWORD=$DB_PASSWORD cachethq/cachet:latest php artisan migrate --force
```

Run Cachet:

```bash
$ docker run -d --name cachet --link mysql:mysql -p 80:8000 -e DB_HOST=mysql -e DB_DATABASE=$DB_DATABASE -e DB_USERNAME=$DB_USERNAME -e DB_PASSWORD=$DB_PASSWORD cachethq/cachet:latest
```

Now go to `http://<ipdockerisboundto>/setup` and have fun!

Note: When running in production you should ensure that you enable SSL.
This is commonly achieved by running Nginx with your certificates on your Docker host, service or load balancers in-front of the running container, or by adding your custom SSL certificates and configuration to the supplied Nginx configuration.
