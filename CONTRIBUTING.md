## Coding Standards

Please follow existing coding standards:

- Spaces around operators and control blocks:
    ```php
    if ($condition) {

    }
    ```
- Braces on the same line. The exception to this rule is for long conditions.
- Line lengths have a soft 80 limit and hard 120 length.
- PHP constants should be in lowercase; `true`, `false` and `null`.
- Defined constants should always be in uppercase.
