# Contribution Guidelines

##Â Creating issues

Issues should be made by using the [issue tracker](https://github.com/cachethq/Cachet/issues).

Things to remember:

- Be descriptive
- Be respectful of others

## Languages

You **must not** write plain-English into the code, rather into the `app/lang/en/` language files (where appropriate). We can then push out the changes to our translators.

The only place where it is advisable to write English text into the code (as opposed to the language file) is for the API.

## Coding Standards

Please follow existing coding standards:

```php
<?php

namespace Foo\Bar\Controller;

use Foo\Bar\Bar;

class Foo extends Bar
{
    public function baz()
    {
        if ($condition)
        {
        }
    }
}

```

- At least one newline seperating `namespace`, `use`, and `class` declarations
- Spaces around operators, loops, conditions and control blocks:
    ```php
    if ($condition === (10 + 2))
    {

    }
    ```
- Braces on a new line.
- Line lengths have a soft 80 limit and hard 120 length.
- PHP constants should be in lowercase; `true`, `false` and `null`.
- Defined constants should always be in uppercase.
- Never leave trailing spaces at the end of a line.
- Files should end with one blank line.
- Do not use Bash (`#`) style comments.

If you're still unsure, then take a look at existing code.

## Introduction into to Git and GitHub

If you are new to git, GitHub, and the whole open source software community, welcome! Here are some resources for getting started and understanding what it's all about.

- [Try Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) by Code School
- [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com)

If you're not particularly fond of the command line, you can get one of GitHub's free GUI desktop apps:

- [GitHub for Mac](https://github.com/blog/1510-installing-git-from-github-for-mac)
- [GitHub for Windows](https://github.com/blog/1127-github-for-windows)

If you're feeling adventurous, you can become a Git & GitHub master with the [Git Path on Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/paths/git).

There is always the Cachet Gitter chat to ask any questions you may have:
